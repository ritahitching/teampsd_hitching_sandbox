# [MTL Live Session 02](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session02_see.Rmd "MTL Live Session 02")

Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Navigating to the Learner See Guide for Session 2 at mtl.how, we see that 
### Today we're modeling to learn how to check our patient data and team trends.

## Learning Objectives
### After this session, you will be able to:

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.  
2. Test out whether your expectations about team historical trends are displayed in the "viz" tabs.  
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

## Participatory Learning from Simulation
This graphic illustrates how **_Modeling to Learn_** can help us to get more of our Veterans to the right place and the right time to meet their needs using participatory learning from simulation.
- We use the data user interface (UI) to look back at team trends over the past two years.
- We review the last two years of data to see *what is* in our team now. 
- Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change.
- Even when we see trends that we like, we may not know what is causing those trends. And, we may be afraid that the next change we might make will undo it. 
- It is also really demotivating to see trends we don't like, and not know what is causing the problem.
- We will use the sim UI to look at team trends 2 years into the future to answer *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make. What we're doing today is that *looking back* using the data UI.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">
- Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.

### Who would like to "drive" today?** [Recommend the Team Lead]  

## *MTL* on BISL  

### 1. Using Internet Explorer browser, navigate to mtl.how/data.  

   a. This will take you to the VAâ€™s corporate data warehouse site, the Business Intelligence Service Line (or BISL), where you will log in with your VA email and PIV passcode. This site contains Protected Health Information (PHI), so as a provider you will be granted access according to the permissions that are set up on your PIV.  

   b. We recommend using Explorer as your browser for this resource is because it's on a SharePoint platform. Microsoft products "play best" with each other and we'll being opening the _Modeling to Learn_ data user interface (UI) in Excel from here today.  

   c. We'll show you how files you pull from here will be saved back to the secure site, so that you can protect patient PHI just as you do in all your work.

   d. On the landing page, select your VISN **______________**. On the next page, select your team's facility **______________**.  
    + A web version of Excel will open on your screen, showing charts from your facility's data.  

### 2. This splash page is designed so see trends relevant to your team vision of **__________________________** for the last two years.  Let's explore the information available in the BISL sharepoint splash page:  

   a. There are two sets scroll bars on the right. The outer one allows the user to scroll up and down the page, where the inner scroll bar scrolls within the graphs on the page.

#### There are three types View options on the upper right menu. __________________ [Team Lead's name] Will you please click through them, so we can see what they each display?

View | Displays 
-- | --
Count | Count tables that match the viz graphs
Data | Sortable report of de-identified individual patient data
Viz | Visualization of trends over time.

#### There are four main data sets in the splash page:
[During intersession prep, facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority data categories that should be emphasized. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.]

Rank | Data | Displays 
-- | -- | --
___ | Diag | Primary diagnoses on visits in that setting level
___ | Enc| Encounter or visits types, such as medication management, psychotherapy, intakes etc.
___ | HF | Health Factors data related to visits, including evidence-based psychotherapy templates, and other clinical reminders and screenings.
___ | Meas| Standaridzed symptom scales, such as the PHQ-9 for depression or PCL-5 for PTSD, and suicide and behavioral risk flags

#### To sum up, there are three ways to view each set of data:  
1. **Counts per month:** countDiag, countEnc, countHF, and countMeas;  
2. **Visual charts of trends over time:**  vizDiag, vizEnc, vizHF, and vizMeas 
3. **Drill down patient-level data:** dataDiag, dataHF, and dataMeas. 
         
  + NOTE: If you click on a data option and get an error message: *PivotTable Operation Failed: the PivotTable report was saved without the underlying data. Use the Refresh Data command to update the report.* Click OK. Go up to the word DATA above the Excel chart and choose *Refresh All Connections.* This error may appear if you have not accessed the data in a while.

#### All data is sortable and filterable so that the team can transparently see how the charting you do all day becomes VA data.

Keep an eye on time |  |  |   

+ For each "viz" chart, you can filter on location and clinic name (upper left) to zoom in to the **clinic** or **VISTA clinic/"grid"**. [During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.]  
   
Rank | viz Options |  |  
-- | -- | -- | 
___ | *vizDiag* | See trends in what types of diagnoses the facility/team is spending their time on (data are based on the primary diagnosis of each encounter, not the problem list for each patient).*
___ | *vizEnc* | See trends in what services the facility/team is spending their time providing.*
___ | *vizHF* | See trends in what specifics the facility/team's patients are getting in their encounters (in vis," this is a very long list. *dataEnc* | can be sorted by encounter type, to see more detail on what happens in any one encounter type in each service).*
___ | *vizMeas* | See trends in what standard measures the facility is using on their patients.  Are they screening more for alcohol use ___ | disorder or depression or PTSD?*   


## 3. Your Team Data Folder - Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page.  

  a. Open the **team's data_ui folder** tailored with the team's name and **open your team data ui in Excel.**  
  
  b. Click on **Control tab.**  
  
  c. Click on the cell next to the word **"Station"** and click on your station number. If you have any issues with permissions, Team PSD can help you.  
  
  d. Click **"Get Clinic List"** to pull in the VISTA clinics that 
  
  e. Next let's look at the various worksheet tabs at the bottom of the Excel file, from left to right:  
  
  - **Control** - Click on the cell next to the word "Station" and select your station number **[ ]**, then click "Get Clinic List" 
  - **ClinicSelection** - Select the the clinics your team would like to include in your team dataset.
  
## 4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team.  

  a. You can sort by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary and Secondary Stopcode.  
  
  b. Or, if your team as designated provider clinics, you can select by provider name.  
  
  c. Note that this will pull all clinics used in the last two years (including de-activated clinics). You can see the de-activated clinics in column I.  

### **You already have a fresh data UI file to work with already in your team data folder.**  
  + It takes some time to stitch together a "hyper-local" query tailored to your team from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse.  
  + On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your data.  
  
- **Prior to today's session, __________________ [Team Lead's name] worked with us to build an initial team dataset.
  
- **__________________ [Team Lead's name], which column did we find most helpful for creating this team's dataset?**
  
- **Are there any adjustments that the team would make to the clinic selection criteria? For example, should we include trainees? Other considerations that seem important?
  
  d. Follow the instructions in **Box A2.**  
  
  e. After filtering, you can double-click on clinics to add them to column A, or you can highlight the clincis and click the gray "add all" button to add them to column A.  

## 5. To view your team patient data and your team trends click on "Get-Patient-level Data." We will not do this in-session today.  
  
  b. We will learn about the "Create Team Data Table for Sim UI" button in our next team meeting.  

## 6. Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.  

  a. Just like the splashpage, there are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.  Your team's vision was about **[ ]**.  Let's go to the **[ ]** viz tab to see data relevant to that issue.  

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:25-00:35***
  b. **What stands out to you about ________________________________**[fill-in team vision]**?  
  
  c. **What is most important to you to check out first related to  ________________________________**[fill-in team vision]?
    [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended quesiton]?  
  
  d. **What is most surprising?**  
    [Prepare in advance, but ask this as an open-ended quesiton]?  

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:35-00:40***

## 7. Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.  

  a. Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks *******  
  
  b. Patient information correponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.  
  
  c. Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports.  
  
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> ***00:40-00:50***  

[During intersession prep facilitator should fill-in the rankings of the highest priority viz that should be emphasized during the team meeting. Follow the team's lead "live" during the meeting, but be prepared.]

Time Stamp | Team Learning Priorities | Script

**[Prioritize which questions you will use given this team's guiding vision.** |  |  |   
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/>  | **Themes from the team vision to be highlighted.** | **Team Data related questions to Prioritize with the Team.**
Keep an eye on time |  |  |   

  d. What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on.  
  
  e. What **viz** tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?  
  
  f. Are there services that have been **increasing over time?** 
  
  g. Are there services that have been **descreasing over time?**  
  
- With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.
