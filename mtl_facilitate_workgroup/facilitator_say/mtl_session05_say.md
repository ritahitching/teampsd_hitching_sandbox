<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "90" width = "90" style ="display: inline-block"/> 

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section.
2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

## Participatory Learning from Simulation [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15">_____ ]

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">

a) In Sessions 2 and 3 we used the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years. That gave us a sense of *what is* in our team now. For example, we saw that ___________________ 

b) Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change. Even when we see a trend we like, we may not know what is causing it, and we may worry that the next change we make will undo it. It can also be demotivating to see trends we don't like and not know what's causing the problem.   

c) Today we're at a turning point where we will begin to use the simulation UI to anticipate future trends. We'll start asking *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make. 

d) With the sim UI we have a way to test our hypotheses about those questions that lets us learn "as quick as we learn not to touch a hot stove". And even more importantly, this virtual world lets us test our "what if" questions without any risk to the well-being of veterans.   

e) Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.  

## In-session Exercise [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

**The Team Lead, or whoever is willing to drive today: open an Internet Explorer browser and a Chrome browser, then share both applications in Adobe Connect.**

**1. Go to the Data UI to copy the name of our team data file so we can upload it to the Sim UI.** [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

a. In session 3, we showed how we used "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" in the data user interface to produce our team data for simulation. We want to grab the filename from there, so in your Explorer browser and go to mtl.how/data.

b. Navigate to the team_data_sim_ui folder and click the "..." so you can copy the filename of your team data for the sim UI.

**2. Go to the sim UI and upload the data file** [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

a. In your Google Chrome browser, go to mtl.how/sim.

b. Enter your login credentials - username is your VA email address and password should have been provided to your team in the Session 5 Pre email.

c. Click the down-arrow in the *Please select a World* pop-up. You see two options - one has "team" in it and the other has "ind" for "individual" in it. Since we're working together now as a team, choose the team world. Any time the team is collaborating together at the same time, this is the world to choose. If you are exploring the sim UI on your own, it's best to select your individual world so you don't inadvertently change anything in the team's world. You are welcome to log in to your individual world any time and play around. There is nothing you can break there!

d. An important thing to note is that this application has a responsive web design, so it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. It will probably look like that if you are logged in on a smartphone. So just keep in mind that there the sim UI may look different on different devices, but all the same functionality is still there.

**3. Let's explore what's on the Home page** [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

a. At the top left is the *MTL* logo. That’s on each page, and it works as a Home button (just like the button next to it).

b. Scanning across that row you see your Team name followed by five navigation icons: Home, Play, Chat, Help, and Logoff. These are pretty self-explanatory, but I would highlight the Logoff button. It's always best to log off when you’re finished with a session. Then at the far right along the top is your name and picture (if you’ve uploaded it).
   
c. Below that row is the *MTL* welcome text, and under that there are 3 section headings in blue bars: Session; Experiment Maintenance; and Team Data Menu Maintenance. Whenever you see blue bars like these with a white triangle on the right, that means those sections can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the bar.
  
d. If you're not designated as a Team Lead, you won't see all of these features. But everyone is the “Team Lead” for their individual world, so will see all of these sections when you're logged in there.

e. We'll be using the other two sections in a minute, but for now let's expand the middle section and take a look. This is where you can manage the experiments you've run - you can delete, rename, or export them from here. Right now it's empty, but it won't be for long!  
  
**4. Now we're on the Sim UI Main Page.** [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

**Don't be too concerned about the newness and complexity you see here! We will take it one bite at a time, and we're just going to zoom in on the parts that are most related to your team's top priority question about _________.** 

a. You see the same information and buttons across the top as the Home page. There's a new set of sections with blue headers below that.

b. The blue bar of the large section on the left names the module and team data file we selected, and inside that section is the model diagram for the _________ module, with an Experiment Timeline section at the top. This is a glimpse of what we're moving into, which is a new way of thinking about your team data. Instead of thinking of it as individual quantities or trends, we see that all those variables are *relational*. Where we're used to thinking about two variables at a time - if we change this it will affect that - now we're going to be able to see, if we change this, how it could affect all these other things.

c) To the right of the main section are 3 blue bars labeled Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text. You can drag the Text section around by the blue bar. You can also expand, minimize, or close it with the icons on the right side of the blue bar: the open square with arrow, or the circle with an X. Expand it to open up the Outputs section, including the Text boxes. Reduce it back to Text-only the same way you expanded it. If you minimize it with the X, you can get it back by going to the Outputs and Text section and selecting Expand.  

**5. Now let's look at your Team Data Table** [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

a. Expand the Experiments Section by clicking on the right down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar. 

b. The data in this table come straight from the file we just uploaded. In fact, throughout the sim UI, we've used the convention that red font means "read in from team data".

c. Click on the "i" in the red circle next to Team Data and read the "i" information. Throughout the Sim UI, we use "i" symbols for information pop-ups. Here, the "i" information is telling you how the data that you record, that you reviewed and chose in the data UI, are used to calculate or estimate the values in this Team Data Table.

d. What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?

e. Close the "i" information and look over the values - how do they strike you? Do they line up with how you think things are in your team? In particular, notice ___________________________________________

f. Notice that the values in this table feed into the system diagram on the left. See if you can find ______  in the system diagram.

**6. Before we exit the Sim UI, let's record the team's top questions in the text box so you'll have them on hand when we come back next time.** [ <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "15" width = "15"> __ ]

a. Open and expand the Outputs and Text section if you need to.

b. Type your question about _________________________________ into the Question box.

c. Click Save. We will discuss naming more next time. For now, just click the down arrow at the first prompt and choose "BC" (stands for Base Case), and Add, then click the Save button at the top. (We do not want to "save and reset".) Click Yes at the prompt.

d. Log out of the sim UI. It's best practice to do that any time you need to turn off or leave your computer for a while.

### That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to log in to our team world.

### DO demo

1. For next time, if you can, log in to to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. 

2. Remember that when you first enter your log-in credentials, you'll be able to choose between your Team world and your Individual world. If you choose your Team world, it will already have a "session" started - because we did that today when we chose the module and selected the team data file that we had added. So you will choose Join Current Session and click Play.

3. If you're ambitious to dig in and "play" in the sim, you can choose your Individual world and add the team data to the team data menu the same way we did just now. Then you can choose the module, select the data, and click Play. You can explore to your heart's content in your Individual world without worrying that you'll "break" anything or change anything for the rest of your team.

4. Whichever way you get to hitting Play from the Sim UI landing page, it will take you to the main page for the module. We encourage you to explore the interface more. 

5. In particular, check out the “i” information available throughout the sim UI - in the Experiments section and in the model diagram - to prepare for our next session. 

## Until next time, thank you for _Modeling to Learn_!
